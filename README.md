Read [**my blog**](https://tobiasvl.github.io), where I write about my projects.

I'm a **hobbyist game developer**, and my games can be found on [my itch.io page](https://tobiasvl.itch.io) (as well as here on GitHub). I like making games in small, restrictive retro-esque game environments such as PICO-8, CHIP-8, bitsy, Game Boy, etc.

I love **retro computing**, and have a few related projects:

* [DRÖM](drom): Lua/LÖVE-based emulator of the [DREAM 6800](http://www.mjbauer.biz/DREAM6800.htm) microcomputer
  * [CHIPOSLO](chiposlo): A modified version of the DREAM's CHIP-8 interpreter, written in M6800 assembly
* [Moon Invaders](moon-invaders): Lua/LÖVE-based emulator of the _Space Invaders_ arcade cabinet
  * [lua-8080](lua-8080): Intel 8080 emulator core written in Lua
* [Optable](optable): A website with opcode tables for various 8-bit CPUs
* [CHIP-8 research](https://chip-8.github.io): A website/organization with information about [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).
